Python data structures are ways of organizing and storing data in a program so that it can be efficiently accessed and modified. Here are some of the fundamental data structures in Python:

Lists:

Description: Ordered, mutable collections of items.
Syntax: my list = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Operations: Adding, removing, and accessing items, slicing.
Tuples:

Description: Ordered, immutable collections of items.
Syntax: my tuple = (1, 2, 3, 4)
Operations: Accessing items, slicing, concatenation (but not modification).
Sets:

Description: Unordered collections of unique items.
Syntax: my set = {1, 2, 3, 4}
Operations: Adding, removing items, set operations like union, intersection.
Dictionaries:

Description: Unordered collections of key-value pairs.
Syntax: my dict = {'key1': 'value1', 'key2': 'value2'}
Operations: Adding, updating, removing items, accessing values by key.
Strings:

Description: Immutable sequences of characters.
Syntax: my string = "Hello, World!"
Operations: Concatenation, slicing, and various string methods.
Queues (using collections.deque):

Description: Data structures that follow the FIFO (First In, First Out) principle.
Syntax: from collections import deque; my queue = deque([1, 2, 3])
Operations: Enqueue (append), dequeue (pop from front).
Stacks (can be implemented with lists or collections.deque):

Description: Data structures that follow the LIFO (Last In, First Out) principle.
Syntax: my stack = [1, 2, 3]
Operations: Push (append), pop (remove last item).
Linked Lists:

Description: Collections of nodes where each node points to the next (and previous, in doubly linked lists).
Syntax: Implemented via custom classes.
Operations: Traversing, inserting, deleting nodes.
Trees and Graphs:

Description: Hierarchical (trees) and network-based (graphs) data structures.
Syntax: Implemented via custom classes.
Operations: Insertion, deletion, traversal.
These data structures are essential for solving various computational problems and implementing efficient algorithms.
