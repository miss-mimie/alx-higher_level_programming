In Python, modules are files containing Python code (functions, classes, variables) that can be imported and used in other Python scripts. You can import both built-in modules (from Python's standard library) and custom modules that you've written.

Commonly Used Python Modules
math: Mathematical functions (e.g., sqrt, sin, cos, etc.)
os: Interacting with the operating system (e.g., file manipulation, environment variables).
sys: System-specific parameters and functions (e.g., sys.argv for command-line arguments).
random: Functions for generating random numbers and choices.
datetime: Working with dates and times.
json: Parsing and generating JSON data.
re: Regular expressions for pattern matching.
numpy: Library for numerical computations (arrays, matrices, etc.).
You can also create your own modules by saving Python files and importing them into other scripts.
